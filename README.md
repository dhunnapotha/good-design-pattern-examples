Curated list of good and easy to understand design pattern examples in ruby.

Note: Pattern names are obfuscated in the file and class names.

### But, Why?
* As of now, it is impossible to find a single repository which has good samples of all design patterns. Trying to fix it.
* I needed a good collection for my [app](http://pluckdp.theox.in)

### Future
* Whenever I come across a good snippet, I will be adding to this collection.
* Planning to maintain ruby as the source for these snippets. I might use [quine-relay](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay) to convert the snippets to other languages.
